    ">#### Quality\n",
    "- wrong datatype for timestamp better be datetime datatype (DONE)\n",
    "- Source coloumn remove the tags to get where the user is tweeting from (iphone, web) (DONE)\n",

    "- name coloumn has a cell value 'a','the','none','such' , - replace none values with nan -> python will recongize it (DONE)\n",

    "- drop unneccessary coloumns in json data (Done)\n",
    "- rating_denominator values has to be 10 (DONE)\n",
    "- remove quoted tweets (Done)\n",

    "- I have set all rating_denominator to 10, and over-writted three wrong values in rating_nominator. \n",
    "- I have used str.replace to replace the values(a, the, such ) with 'none', then set all the none values to Nan.\n",
