    "Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon."

One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog \"stage\" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive \"enhanced.\" Of the 5000+ tweets, I have filtered for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356)\n",
    "#### Additional Data via the Twitter API\n",
    ">Back to the basic-ness of Twitter archives: retweet count and favorite count are two of the notable column omissions. Fortunately, this additional data can be gathered by anyone from Twitter's API. Well, \"anyone\" who has access to data for the 3000 most recent tweets, at least. But you, because you have the WeRateDogs Twitter archive and specifically the tweet IDs within it, can gather this data for all 5000+. And guess what? You're going to query Twitter's API to gather this valuable data.\n",
